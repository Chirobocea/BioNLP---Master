Welcome to the repository for the BioNLP course, completed as part of the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bucharest. This repository contains a group project focused on health disorder detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we tackled the problem of detecting health disorders through analysis of biomedical text. Leveraging NLP methods, our goal was to identify and classify health-related disorders from text data, enabling better understanding and early detection.
